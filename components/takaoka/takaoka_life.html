                I am really enjoying my life at the College of Technology. Attending this school is a new challenge and
                growth opportunity for me.
                The classes are very well organized and allow me to acquire specialized knowledge and practical skills.
                I especially like the <strong>programming</strong> classes and am excited to learn about system design
                and development. It is also great to be able to materialize my ideas through experiments and projects.
                There are plenty of off-campus activities and opportunities to join clubs and societies. I am a member
                of the astronomy club and observe celestial objects on a daily basis.
                There are many restaurants and cafes around the school where you can enjoy time with your friends. The
                school also has a well-equipped library and laboratories where students can concentrate on their
                studies.
                I am currently a fifth-year student at Tsuyama National College of Technology, and I am a member of the
                Mori Information Systems Laboratory. My research theme is neurofeedback using brain waves. I am studying
                how human brain activity can be altered.
                Our school's peaceful campus is filled with beautiful nature. This environment enhances our research
                activities.
