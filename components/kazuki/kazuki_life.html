    <h1>My life in NIT</h1>
    <div class="center-list">
    <p>
        I would like to describe my life at <em class="sample1"> National College of Technology</em> by grade.<br>
        First of all, I am a <em class="sample2">first-year</em> student. <br>
        I had to sit in a chair for an hour and a half to study, and I had to be involved in club activities.<br> 
        In addition, we had to join club activities, which made time management difficult.<br>
        Next came the <em class="sample2">second year</em>. <br>
        At this point, the students were divided into four different departments.<br>
        Specialized subjects were added, and it was difficult to keep up with the classes.<br>
        Therefore, I concentrated on the classes more than in the first year.<br>
        In the <em class="sample2">third year</em>.<br>
        There was a cross-division of all the departments, which stimulated me a lot. <br>
        In order to go further into college, grades from this year became very important. <br>
        Therefore, they prepared carefully for each test and took on the challenge.<br>
        In the <em class="sample2">fourth year</em>.<br> 
        I needed to decide on a career path, so I participated in open schools and internships to gather information. <br>
        In order to gain more experience, I lived my life with off-campus activities in mind.<br>
        In the <em class="sample2">fifth year</em>.<br>
        I was able to finalize my career path early and am in the process of starting my graduation research. <br>
        Since he can decide some of the dates on his own, he needs to plan carefully.<br>
        Looking back on your life at the technical college so far, <br>
        what are the points that you should pay attention to?<br>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Points to keep in mind when living as a student:
                <ol>
                    <li>Submit your assignments</li>
                    <li>Don't be overdue for absences</li>
                    <li>Interact with seniors and get past papers</li>
                    <li>Do off-campus activities to make your résumé easier to write.</li>
